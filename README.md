Manage packages on macOS and Linux with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Installation

This package is in its (very) early stages, so it is not yet available
on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org). You can install the latest
development version by running:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("briandconnelly/homebrew)
```
